    NEXT DAY DISPATCH
All orders received by 1 pm PST will usually be dispatched the following business day. On occasion and due to high demand this may increase to 2 business days (or more) after your order has been placed. Our warehouse team processes orders as fast as possible and in these times we ask for your patience. 
Note: 
If an order is placed on the weekend or public holiday, please note dispatch ETA times (as referenced above) will begin from the next working day. 
Once a dispatch notification with a tracking number has been sent, your order will be marked as dispatched.
Recently dispatched orders may not have left our warehouse yet however the courier will collect the order either the same day or the next business day.
Please allow 12 hours for the consignment number to register in the courier tracking system. 
ORDER STATUS
Hold - The payment is still being processed, the address may have been entered incorrectly and many more reasons. We will be in touch if we need more information from you before shipping the order out.

Pick: The order is ready to be shipped out to your selected address and will be handled by warehouse staff in the next 5 business days.

Pack: The order is being prepared for shipment by the warehouse staff.

Dispatched: The order has been packed and is now in either of the following two stages.

1.    Recently dispatched orders may not have left our warehouse yet however the courier will collect the order either the same day or next business day. This means orders dispatched late in the afternoon may not be collected until the following business day. Orders dispatched late Friday afternoon may not be collected by our courier until Monday. 

2.   Your order has left our warehouse, has an active consignment number (which can be tracked) and is in transit for delivery.
