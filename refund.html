Feel free to unpack and assemble the bike for sizing and inspection purposes. However, we kindly request that you refrain from test rides to avoid any wear and tear. Failure to comply with these terms or returning bikes in anything less than "as new" condition may result in a minimum restocking fee of $50 or even void the right to a refund.(see examples below).
If your bike arrived damaged, please report it as soon as possible. Snap some photos of the damage and email them to us via our contact form.

If the bike sustains damage during the return transit due to inadequate packaging by the customer, we reserve the right to charge you the cost of replacing the damaged part or component. Be sure to check out our repacking guide. 
Refunds will be processed after one of our mechanics thoroughly inspects the returned bike. Please understand that this process may take up to 5 business days after the bike is received. 
Refunds will be issued promptly once the bike receives approval from our mechanics. In the rare case of an issue during inspection, we'll contact you regarding policy violations and fees. Please note that some banks may take up to 10 business days to finalize the transaction after we issue the refund. 
The refund for the bike does not include any shipping costs associated with your original transaction. However, the return shipping within our 30-day policy is on the house. Contact our Team for more information.
